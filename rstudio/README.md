# Rstudio devcontainer

For the devcontainer CLI to find the .devcontainer.json of the Rstudio application, provide the path to the .devcontainer.json relative to the root folder of this repository (i.e. rstudio/rstudio).

An inverting proxy agent is running along side the Rstudio application to authenticate the request to logging into the Rstudio app.
