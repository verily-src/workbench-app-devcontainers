# Original extension is https://github.com/QuantStack/jupyterlab-snippets;
# however, this does not support JupyterLab 4. There is an [open
# PR](https://github.com/QuantStack/jupyterlab-snippets/pull/43) to add
# JupyterLab 4 support, but it has not been merged and seems to be inactive, so
# we'll just build off of the PR branch for now.
