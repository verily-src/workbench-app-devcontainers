# Set variables into the .bashrc such that they are available to terminals, notebooks, and other tools. 
# We have new-style variables (eg WORKBENCH_USER_EMAIL) which are set here and CLI (terra app execute env). 
# We also support a few variables set for legacy reasons (eg GOOGLE_PROJECT). Those are only set here and 
# NOT in the CLI as they are intended just to make porting existing notebooks easier.
# 
# Keep in sync with Workbench CLI environment variables:

# Note that this script is intended to be source from the "post-startup.sh" script 
# and is dependent on some variables and packages already being set up:
#
# - emit:  function to echo a message with a timestamp
# - USER_BASHRC: path to user's ~/.bashrc file
# - CLOUD: aws/gcp
# - LOG_IN: whether the user is logged into the wb CLI as part of the script
# - RUN_AS_LOGIN_USER: run command as non-root Unix user (ex: jupyter, dataproc)
# - USER_WORKBENCH_CONFIG_DIR: user's WB configuration directory
# 
# This script must be run after install-cli.sh
